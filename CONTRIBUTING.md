# Contributing to DAViewer

Thanks for wanting to help! DAViewer is a community client for DeviantArt built
on [DAKit](https://github.com/redtidev1918/dakit). Contributions of any size are
welcome — bug reports, fixes, features, translations, and documentation.

## Before you start

- **SDK vs app**: DAViewer is the app; [DAKit](https://github.com/redtidev1918/dakit)
  is the SDK it depends on. If a change belongs in the SDK (API adapters, OAuth,
  domain models, transfers), open the PR over there and publish it first, then
  bump the dependency here.
- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/redtidev1918/daviewer/issues) and
  PRs before opening a new one.
- For security issues, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and do **not** file them
  publicly.

## Development setup

1. Install Flutter 3.47.1 (the project pins this version).
2. `flutter pub get`
3. Run `dart format lib test`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` before
   committing — all must pass.
4. For a full build, see [Build notes](docs/build.md).

> The project deliberately pins `flutter_inappwebview 6.1.5` and specific
> Gradle/AGP/Kotlin versions (see the [toolchain pin](docs/build.md#toolchain-pin)).
> Do not upgrade these without verifying the toolchain compatibility.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change. Keep commits focused and descriptive.
3. `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` locally.
4. Open a pull request. Explain **what** changed and **why**.

> Pushing to `main` runs the full CI pipeline (quality checks plus Android, macOS,
> and Windows builds). For documentation-only commits, add `[skip ci]` to the
> commit message (e.g. `docs: fix typo [skip ci]`) to skip CI. A GitHub Release
> is created only when a `v*` tag is pushed (via the manual Release workflow), so
> ordinary pushes never release by themselves.

## Style

- Follow the existing code style; run `dart format lib test` before committing.
- Keep user-facing strings in `lib/core/l10n/app_strings.dart` (Chinese + English).
- Treat list-endpoint artwork as potentially sparse. Hydrate detail-only fields
  through the canonical repository and merge them through `ArtworkStore`; never
  let a later feed refresh erase richer cached data.
- At 1x zoom, horizontal gestures may navigate between artworks. Once zoomed,
  the image viewer owns both axes and outer navigation recognizers must be off.
- Prefer small, reviewable PRs over large, mixed ones.
