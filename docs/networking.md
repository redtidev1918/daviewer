# Networking and proxy

DAViewer separates two routes that the operating system genuinely separates:

- **App traffic**: OAuth token exchange, API, images, video, downloads, and
  hidden public website adapters.
- **System-browser traffic**: the one official sign-in/registration page and
  any DeviantArt, Google, Apple, Facebook, or verification pages it opens.

The app can configure its own route but cannot silently reconfigure an external
browser. UI and diagnostics must describe this boundary instead of promising
that one successful test covers both routes.

## Selection and persistence

The App runtime priority is:

1. a persisted in-app manual proxy;
2. the OS system proxy (`scutil` on macOS, registry on Windows, GNOME manual
   HTTPS/HTTP settings on Linux);
3. `https_proxy`, `http_proxy`, or `all_proxy` (lowercase and uppercase);
4. `DAKIT_PROXY_URL` supplied at build time;
5. direct connection.

The settings screen accepts an HTTP CONNECT proxy as `host:port` or a full URL
such as `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>`. `<PORT>` is a placeholder: users enter the
HTTP/Mixed listener displayed by their own proxy app. On mobile,
`127.0.0.1` means the proxy runs on that same phone. A proxy on a computer or
router requires its LAN IP and an enabled “allow LAN” option.

`export all_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` works when launching from that shell.
Finder, Start Menu, and most desktop launchers do not inherit the variable, so
release users should prefer the persisted App setting for App traffic and a
system proxy or VPN for browser sign-in.

Clearing the manual setting immediately re-runs automatic detection. The
connectivity test sends a bounded DeviantArt request through the effective App
route. It reports App reachability only; detailed socket errors remain in
Diagnostics.

## Platform coverage

| Platform | App API / media / downloads | Hidden public browser adapter | Sign-in WebView |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | system/VPN or dynamic App proxy | process-wide WebView override | same process-wide WebView override |
| Windows | dynamic App proxy | shared WebView2 `--proxy-server` | same shared WebView2 `--proxy-server` |
| macOS 14+ | dynamic App proxy | `WKWebsiteDataStore.proxyConfigurations` | same `WKWebsiteDataStore.proxyConfigurations` |
| macOS 12/13 | dynamic App proxy | OS system proxy only | OS system proxy only |
| Linux | not a current build target (no `linux/` platform directory; CI builds Android/macOS/Windows only) | — | — |

If Linux support is added later, note that on GNOME `none` ignores stale
host/port values and `manual` prefers HTTPS before HTTP, and PAC `auto` cannot
be represented by `dart:io`'s static proxy directive — DAViewer would log the
limitation and continue to environment, build-time, or direct fallback.

Windows hidden WebViews and cookie reads share one WebView2 environment. This
keeps public adapter cookies and proxy behavior consistent; it is not a second
authentication session.

## Sign-in recovery flow

The login route starts with native UI. It exposes one official sign-in action,
the current effective App route, proxy settings, a connectivity test, and public
Settings/Diagnostics routes.

OAuth opens once in the app's embedded WebView, on the same network path as the
hidden adapter. DeviantArt's page decides which account and provider controls are
available. The user can close and reopen the login screen or cancel the pending
PKCE transaction. On Windows, the ZIP build registers `dakit://oauth/callback`
below `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\dakit` for the external-browser fallback and
forwards a second-process activation to the running app.

Provider and edge security checks can intentionally return HTTP 403, 429, or
503 while presenting an interactive page. They are completed inside the embedded
WebView. DAViewer neither labels those pages as an App connection failure nor
attempts brittle DOM detection. If the WebView cannot reach the page, users fix
the App route (proxy/VPN); the App connectivity test reports that same route.

## Maintainer checks

Before a network or authentication release:

1. verify direct, automatic, manual, environment, and clearing behavior;
2. test `all_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` with working and stopped proxies;
3. verify App connectivity copy does not claim to test an external browser;
4. complete DeviantArt and available social-provider authorization in the
   embedded WebView, including callback, close/reopen, cancel, and cold-start
   callback;
5. verify a provider challenge remains entirely in the interactive WebView and
   the App keeps waiting without a false network verdict;
6. verify successful authorization opens Home recommendations without another
   login or web-session prompt;
7. verify hidden public adapters can refresh anonymously and degrade without a
   login prompt;
8. on Windows, verify protocol registration, process forwarding, and a moved
   release folder;
9. keep raw proxy, HTTP, parsing, and package details in Diagnostics only.
